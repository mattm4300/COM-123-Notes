# CONSTRUCTING THE SPEECH BODY

## THE BENEFITS OF ORGANIZATION
* Organization increases identification between an audience and a speaker in three ways:
     * improving comprehension
     * decreasing uncertainty
     * improving retention

### Organization and Comprehension

## BASIC SPEECH STRUCTURE
* All speeches have an intro., a body, and a conclusion.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES

* As a general guideline, speeches should have at least 2 main points but no greater than 5.
* Common practice suggests that **3** is a good number to have.

## Sub-Points
* (DEF) [Sub-Point]: An argument or claim that supports, justifies, or clarifies the main point and comprise some of the sub-structure of a speech.

## Titling Main Points
* (DEF) [Signpost]: A transitional statement from one main point to another using a tag.
