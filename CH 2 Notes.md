# Chapter 2 Notes
## OLD SCHOOL SPEECH CONSTRUCTION
* In Cicero's book, *De Inventione*, Cicero argued that speakers with rhetorical training possess five abilities that enable them to create effective speeches:
	* invention
	* arrangement
	* linguistic style
	* memory
	* delivery

### Invention
* (DEF) [Invention]: the generation of ideas, information, and arguments that a speaker will use to create a speech.
* In other words, it's the process of finding out what the speaker should say.

### Arrangment
* (DEF) [Arrangement]: how supporting material and main ideas are organized within a speech.
	* **FIRST**, identify the main points of the **body** of the speech.
	* Then, identify what material seems to work best for the **intro** and **conclusion**.

### Linguistic Style
* (DEF) [Linguistic Style]: the language choices made by the speaker that increase the uniqueness and memorability of the speech.
	* Think JFK speech, Martin Luther King, etc.

### Memory
* Greek teachers of puhlic speaking techniques, called sophists, encouraged their students to memorize popular or common themes that could be used repeatedly, in somewhat the way "talking points" work today.
	* These themes were called **topoi**--meaning "commonplaces".
* (DEF) [Memory]: practice techniques and how speakers remain in control of their material when they present a speech.

### Modes of Presentation
* **Memorized**--remembering every word of a speech and reciting it back.
	* Sounds more like being talked-at rather than talked-to.
* **Manuscript**--speaker writes down the entire speech and reads from the paper or at least references the paper copy.
* **Extemporaneous**--most effective. spur of the of moment style.
	* **Speaking competently and conversationally with limited preparation using limited notes.**
* To create limited notes, we use two outlines:
	* **Preparation Outline**: outline developed in the invention and arrangement of the speech
	* **Presentation Outline**: the outline used during practice and for the actual delivery of the speech

### Delivery
* (DEF) [Delivery]: the speaker's use of his or her voice and body during the presentation of the speech.
* Some delivery factors:
	* accents
	* rapid speech
	* eye contact

## PURPOSE AND THESIS STATEMENTS
* Start by identifying a **goal** and what will serve as the **purpose** of the speech.
	* What, ultimately, should the audience get out of the speech?
* (DEF) [**Specific Purpose Statement**]: a concise statement of the desired audience response indicating what you want your listeners to be able to know, fee, or do when you finiish speaking.
* (DEF) [**Thesis**]: the concise summary of our topic and specific speech goal. (Usually 1 sentence.)

## INTRODUCTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
* In an essay, a thesis can be long and complex, but in a speech a thesis needs to be concise so that listeners can easily recognize and remember it.
* The first thing we say during a speech is called the "attention-getting device."
* (DEF) [Body]: a section of a speech that clarifies and justifies the thesis statement.

## OVERCOMING SPEECH ANXIETY
* (DEF) [Glossophobia]: The fear of public speaking.

## COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION AND WHY IT MATTERS
* (DEF) [Communication Apprehension]: individual level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons.

## DECREASING COMMUNICATION APPREHENSION
