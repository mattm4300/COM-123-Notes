# Public Speaking Notes

## Chapter 1

### Defining Communitcation
* (DEF) [rhetorical situation]: The framework for how we study and perform public speaking
* Communication comes from the latin word that means "to share."


#### The SMCR Model of Communication
* In the 1960s, david Berlo theorized that communication consisted of 4 primary components:
	* a source,
	* a message,
	* a channel,
	* and a receiver.
* The "source" is the person speaking.
* The "channel" is the manner thorugh which the receiver obtains a message from a source, predominantly the five senes.
* The reciever is the person who "decodes" the message from the source.

#### Conceptual Factors Influencing Communication
* Even though the SMCR model is useful, it does not explain how somtimes the source and the receiver have very different interpretations of the same message.
* (DEF) [Feedback]: Any response (verbal or nonverbal) from the listener during the communication process.
	* Comes in two primary forms: immediate & delayed
	* Immediate feedback includes verbal and nonverbal responses.
		* Nonverbal feedback here is like head nods, eye contact, etc.
		* Verbal contact includes questions, words of affirmation, and noises that aren't exactly words.
	* Delayed feedback refers to any response from listeners hours or days after a speech and can include written critiques, evaluations, and comments.
* (DEF) [The Imperfection of Language]: We know that communication can also fail simply because language is imperfect.
	* Words are representations of the things to which they refer--they are not those actual things.
	* a.k.a., becuase language is **symbolic**, it can have multiple meanings and interpretations.
* (DEF) [Noise]: Anything that inhibits a listener from understanding a message.
	* Can be internal or external.
		* External: air conditioner
		* Internal: concentration-breaking thoughts

### Communication in Context
* (DEF) [Interpersonal Communication]: communication with other people that ranges from the highly personal to the high impersonal.
* Human communication is divided into six types:
	* **Interpersonal**
	* (DEF) [Intrapersonal]: Communication within ourselves.
	* (DEF) [Impersonal]: communication between two people about general information; the people usually are not close.
	* (DEF) [Group/Small Group]: communication that occurs among members of a meeting, team, or discussion group.
	* (DEF) [Mass]: communication created and disseminated by media outlets to large audiences.
	* (DEF) [Public]: Any communication that occurs between a speaker and at least 10 audience members.
* Public comm. is more formal.
* Public comm. includes signposting.
* Public comm. includes sourcing.
* Public comm. is done by one person.

### The Rhetorical Situation
* (DEF) [Rhetorical Situation]: Any situation in which people's understanding can be changed by a mesage.
* There are 4 components to rhetorical situation:
	* The occasion,
	* audience,
	* speaker,
	* and the speech.

### AUDIENCE
#### Identification w/ the audience
* To be effective, speakers must find differences and similarities between themselves and their audience and then work to find ways to identify with their audience through their messages.  Burke described two ways for speakers to achieve identification in their messages: **common ground** and **vilification**.

#### Captive vs Voluntary Audiences
* Captive: audience must attend.
* Voluntary: audience may choose to stay or leave.

### OCCASION
(DEF) [Exigence]: a problem that can be helped, not necessarily solved, through a speech.

#### Types of Occasions
* Ceremonial--usually focused on praise. Wedding toast, eulogies, awards, etc.
* Deliberative--focus on the future and try to determine a plan or course of action.  Congress, etc.
* Forensic--focus on the past and aim to render judgement about past actions.  Court case, etc.

### SPEAKER
* Aristotle said every speech should include 3 things: logos, ethos, and pathos.
	* (DEF) [Logos]: logical appeals.
		* Speeches should be supported, structured well, and reasoned.
	* (DEF) [Pathos]: emotional appeals.
		* a speaker should also address the human issues raised by the exigence.
	* (DEF) [Ethos]: The speaker's credibility as perveived by the members of the audience.

### SPEECH
* It is simply the message as it is presented to the audience.
* As we begin to prepare the speech, we create a **preparation outline**
	* This is a complete, full-sentence outline that we create as we gather source material, arrange main ideas, and generate arguments.
* When delivering the speech, we may use a **presentation outline**
	* This is a short keyword outline written or typed on note cards.
* Every speech should have an introduction, a body, and a conclusion
* In order for the speech to be clear, it should have a clear and concise thesis statement and a preview statement.
	* The thesis statement should be a brief but coplete statement of the main goal of the speech.
